# Role based authentication in Angular 2

Consider our application is for a apartment user , there are two roles now 
Resident ( which performs some action like pay maintance etc)
Admin ( Manages the entire account )
Our agenda from client side would to hide or restrict certain elements for a particular user based on the role . In short role-based authenticationÂ is an approach to restricting system access to authorized users.
I have my best to make it simple and understanding

## Development server

I have used Angular Cli for building this application.
Run npm install 
Run ng serve
The site will openup in localhost:4200

## Admin Credential 
 username :  admin
 password : admin

## resident Credential
 username: A001
 password : open@A001
